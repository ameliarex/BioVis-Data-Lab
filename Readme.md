**How to run the zoo data converter?**

1. Download and install *Processing* (if you do not have it on your computer). See [Processing](www.processing.org). 
2. Download the program (lab2.pde) and the zoo data set (zoo.data) from the GitHub repository "BioVis-Data-Lab", and put them all in one folder. 
3. Open lab2.pde with *Processing* and hit "Run".
4. The output file will then be generated in the same folder you save the program. You can also download the sample output file (zoo.csv) in the same repository to check the results.
5. Have fun!
